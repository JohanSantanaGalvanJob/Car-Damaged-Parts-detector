# Car-Damaged-Parts-detector
Project made for detecting different damaged parts of a car like scratches or broken glass. After the train model is settled, It will load in on a little Android Studio Application.

The Page from which I took the dataset is this one: https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=car%20defect
Also I saw this video which explains how to load a YOLO model in an Android application: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl7rCmvIyiI&list=LL&index=2&t=310s
